# Another Sinatra Bootstrap #
This is a minimal bootstrap allowing for faster Sinatra-based development.

It's inspired by Adam Stacoviak's [sinatra-bootstrap](https://github.com/adamstac/sinatra-bootstrap), but far more minimal.

## Included are: ##
* Sinatra (wow)
* [sinatra-reloader](https://github.com/rkh/sinatra-reloader)
* [Haml](http://haml-lang.com/)
* [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/)
* [Compass](http://compass-style.org/)
* [Barista](https://github.com/Sutto/barista)
